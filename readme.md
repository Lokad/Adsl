This repository contains a F\# implementation of ADSL.

ADSL is A Differentiable Sub Language that is intended to lower relational language. It is a simple language where Automatic Differentiation is a first class citizen. 
ADSL is closed by differentiation: the adjoint, i.e. the derived program, of an ADSL program is also a differentiable ADSL program. This closure gives immediate access to higher order derivatives


ADSL is at the core of differentiable programming at Lokad.
